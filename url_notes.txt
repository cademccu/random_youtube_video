damn

base 64 - using the set of all upper/lower letters, number, -_

26 + 26 + 10 + 2


could also LOOKUP random things and pull teh first few URLS

==================================
VALIDATING RANDOMLY GENERATED URLS
==================================

* curl'ing the URL
    returns the webpage and a 200 response -- not ideal as it would
    be perfect if it threw  a 404 or something else that could be easily
    parsed.

    can literally grep for "This video isn't available anymore" which seems
    to work reliably, but is hackey

* wget the page
    same as above, returns whole entire HTML and 200 status code


TODO
generate several random urls -- command line option to do so




https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random

returns a random wikpedia page...
